# YouTube.com Clone Project

Welcome to my YouTube.com clone project! This project is a front-end recreation of the popular video sharing platform, focusing on replicating its look and feel using pure HTML and CSS. It showcases my ability to create responsive, interactive web designs from scratch, without the use of frameworks and external libraries.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to fit screens of various sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes stylized buttons, a search bar, and tooltips that mimic the functionality of YouTube's interface.
- **Custom Thumbnails:** Utilizes custom thumbnails for video previews, demonstrating the implementation of images within a web design context.
- **Video Grid Layout:** Features a grid layout for video previews, similar to YouTube's homepage, showcasing CSS grid and flexbox layout skills.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including the use of preprocessor files (general.css, header.css, sidebar.css, video.css) to organize styles more efficiently.
- **Google Fonts:** For custom fonts (Roboto and Roboto Condensed) to closely match the aesthetic of YouTube.
